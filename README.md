# BrewDocs

BrewDocs a digital homebrewing handbook, toolkit, and brew day application built as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

The project is focused on demonstrating state-of-the-art technology while dogfooding my homebrewing interest.
It takes advantage of the popular and powerful Next.js framework, and is primarily written in React and Tailwind.
The mission is to create a completely offline web application, known as a Progressive Web App,
which will also be used to demonstrate how Next.js supports incremental, progressive development which makes it perfect
for small companies and projects with a long road ahead of them.
