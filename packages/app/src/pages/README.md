# Why Pages Router?

At this time, the Next.js "App Router" does not support client-side dynamic params, but "Pages Router" does. Since the goal
of this project is to incrementally add more complex features, sticking with Next.js is prudent, but the core of the
product is intended to be a completely static Single-Page Application--meaning no servers or backends.
