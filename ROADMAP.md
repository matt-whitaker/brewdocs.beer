# BrewDocs Roadmap

This document outlines the known roadmap of the BrewDocs application.

## Overview

I myself am both a software engineer and homebrewer, so it makes sense that I would be interested in building my own homebrewing
application from scratch. Since I am still early in my amateur homebrewing days, this roadmap will be prioritized generally
in order of what capabilities I need. Some more advanced brewing concepts may be deprioritized due to this.
If you are looking for a full-fledged homebrewing application, you'll have to be patient.

## 1. Proof of Concept

### Milestones
- **UI Prototype** -
  Data is baked into the build, and user input is simulated. Changes are tied to the session and lost on page exit. Pure UI demo
- **Brew Day**
  Simple form interface for collecting brew day measurements
- **Splash**
  Basic splash site on brewdocs.beer for SEO, PWA is served via app.brewdocs.beer
- **Library**
  The basic scaffold of the library for information lookup
