# BrewDocs Roadmap

This document outlines the known roadmap of the BrewDocs application.

## Overview

I myself am both a software engineer and homebrewer, so it makes sense that I would be interested in building my own homebrewing
application from scratch. Since I am still early in my amateur homebrewing days, this roadmap will be prioritized generally
in order of what capabilities I need. Some more advanced brewing concepts may be deprioritized due to this.
If you are looking for a full-fledged homebrewing application, you'll have to be patient.

## 1. Proof of Concept

Introduce the project to the world. This is a bare minimum skeleton UI demo with basic marketing / product blog.

### Milestones
- **UI Prototype** -
  - Data is baked into the build, and user input is simulated.
  - Changes are tied to the session and lost on page exit.
  - Basic validation for some pizazz
- **Brew Day**
  - Simple form interface for collecting brewing measurements.
  - Brewing and Fermentation are combined under one tab/flow.
- **Splash**
  - Basic splash site on brewdocs.beer for SEO, PWA is served via app.brewdocs.beer
- **Product Blog**
  - Basic blog page on the splash site for announcements and release notes
- **Knowledge Base**
  - Basic scaffold and "wizard of oz" for the search everything feature
- **Announcement**
  - first announcement when ready

## 2. Usable Prototype

Recipes are still baked in, but batches are now saved for record keeping. Will include a marketing release blog.

- **Save batches**
  - Can view batches across page loads
- **Brew Day**
  - Additional note taking capabilities
- **Knowledge Base**
  - BCJS populated?
   - BeerXML support - populate with recipes as well
- **Announcement**
  - announce when ready
